      <h1>How do boids work?</h1>
      <p>
        A boid represents an individual in a flock. To treat this as a physics
        simulation, each boid will have a position, velocity, and acceleration.
        We will represent boids as a circle with a black velocity vector and red
        acceleration vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        The movement of boids will be affected by the movement of the flock
        itself. To simulate real flocking behavior, each boid will be affected
        by its <b>local</b>
        flock. This is because real animals are affected not by the movements of
        the entire flock, but just those close to it. We will apply 3 primary
        forces on each boid:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Cohesion:</b> Steer towards local flock</li>
        <li><b>Alignment:</b> Move in the same direction as local flock</li>
        <li><b>Separation:</b> Avoid crowding local flock</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We will discuss how each force is generated.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
      <h1>Applied Forces</h1>
      <p>
        For each frame of the simulation, we calculate the total vector of every
        force applied on the boid, and clamp it such that there is a max force.
        Then, we will treat that force as the instantaneous acceleration at that
        given time as <em>F = ma</em> (treat m = 1).
      </p>
      <p>
        For each type of force, we will scale that force by some constant, which
        we can control using the sliders in our simulation. That way, we can
        effectively see the effects of each force separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each boid is given a perception radius to recognize the boids in its
        local flock. The cohesive force is the vector pointing towards the
        average mass of the local flock, which we can calculate by taking the
        average position. Similarly, the alignment force is the vector
        corresponding to the average velocity of the local flock.
      </p>
      <p>
        The separation force considers a smaller crowding radius, about a third
        of the perception radius. If we take the inverse of the square of the
        distance between two boids, we will result in a much larger number the
        closer the boids are. Using this fact, we take the average of this force
        applied from each boid inside the crowding radius, resulting in a force
        that pushes the boids away from each other if they are too close.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter">
      <h1>Limitations and Continuations</h1>
      <p>
        The boids algorithm is slow as for each boid, we iterate over each boid
        in its local flock, which is calculated once each frame. As we add more
        boids, the simulation slows down quadratically. One solution to this is
        to create regions in the simulation space, where each boid only has to
        check if the boids in a neighboring region is in the local flock. One
        popular way to implement this is using a quadtree data structure, making
        smaller sections as boids become more clustered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the base computational model is made, as the controls of boids is
        purely done with forces, we can simply introduce other sources of forces
        to improve the simulation. In our example, toggling wrap enabled forces
        being introduced from the border, keeping the flock inside the canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could introduce a new boid called a predator, which follows the
        flock. Then, the flock could be applied a force away from the predator
        as it gets closer, simulating a flock of prey fleeing. Another example
        is to add a barrier that emits a force away from it, creating an
        obstacle.
